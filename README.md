Trying to get a voice controlled BT keyboard

Based on https://gist.github.com/ukBaz/a47e71e7b87fbc851b27cde7d1c0fcf0#file-btk_server-py for the integration to bluetooth

which was based on  http://yetanotherpointlesstechblog.blogspot.com/2016/04/emulating-bluetooth-keyboard-with.html

I'm going to tie in voice recognition if I get this working
